    "What is our goal for the argubot? We'd like it to broaden the thinking of the (simulated) human that it is talking to. Indeed, that's what Alice's prompt tells Alice to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "This goal is inspired by the recent paper [Opening up Minds with Argumentative Dialogues](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.335/), which collected human-human dialogues:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this work, we focus on argumentative dialogues that aim to open up (rather than change) people’s minds to help them become more understanding to views that are unfamiliar or in opposition to their own convictions. ... Success of the dialogue is measured as the change in the participant’s stance towards those who hold opinions different to theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments of this sort are not like chess or tennis games, with an actual winner. The argubot will almost never hear a human say \"You have convinced me that I was wrong.\" But the argubot did a good job if the human developed increased understanding and respect for an opposing point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out whether this happened, we can use a questionnaire to ask the human what they thought after the dialogue. For example, after Alice talks to Bob, we'll ask Bob to evaluate what he thinks of Alice's views. Of course, that depends on his personality -- Alice needs to talk to him in a way that reaches him (as much as possible). We'll also ask an outside observer to evaluate whether Alice handled the conversation with Bob well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we're still not going to use real humans. Bob is a fake person, and so is the outside observer (whose name is Judge Wise). Using an LLM as an eval metric is known as model-based evaluation. It has pros and cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is cheaper, faster, and more replicable than hiring actual humans to do the evaluation.\n",
    "* It might give different answers than what humans would give.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social scientists usually refer to a metric's reliability (low variance) and validity (low bias). So the points above say that model-based evaluation is reliable but not necessarily valid. In general, an LLM-based metric (like any metric) needs to be validated to confirm that it really does measure what it claims to measure. (For example, that it correlates strongly with some other measure that we already trust.) In this homework, we'll skip this step and just pray that the metric is reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this works out in practice, **open up the `demo` notebook**, which walks you through the evaluation protocol. You'll see how to call the starter code, how it talks to the LLM behind the scenes, and what it is able to accomplish."

And the OpenAI messages do not necessarily form a natural-language dialogue: some of the messages are dealing with instructions, few-shot prompting, tool use, and so on.

    "* They don't respond to the user's actual statement, but to a single retrieved Kialo claim that may not accurately reflect the user's position (it just overlaps in words).\n",
    "\n",
    "But we also have access to an LLM, which is able to generate new, contextually appropriate text (as Alice does).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will create an argubot named Aragorn, who is basically the love child of Akiko and Alice, combining the high-quality specific content of Kialo with the broad competence of an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG in aRAGorn's name stands for **retrieval-augmented generation**. Aragorn is an agent that will take 3 steps to compute its `Agent.response()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query formation step:** Ask the LLM what claim should be responded to. For example, consider the following dialogue:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >  ... Aragorn: Fortunately, the vaccine was developed in record time. Human: Sounds fishy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Sounds fishy\" is exactly the kind of statement that Akiko had trouble using as a Kialo query. But Aragorn shows the whole dialogue to the LLM, and asks the LLM what the human's last turn was really saying or implying, in that context. The LLM answers with a much longer statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >  Human [paraphrased]: A vaccine that was developed very quickly cannot be trusted. If its developers are claiming that it is safe and effective, I question their motives.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This paraphrase makes an explicit claim and can be better understood without the context. It also contains many more word types, which makes it more likely that BM25 will be able to find a Kialo claim with a nontrivial number of those types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieval step:** Look up claims in Kialo that are similar to the explicit claim. Create a short \"document\" that describes some of those claims and their neighbors on Kialo.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieval-augmented generation:** Prompt the LLM to generate the response (like any `LLMAgent`). But include the new \"document\" somewhere in the LLM prompt, in a way that it influences the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thus, the LLM can respond in a way that is appropriate to the dialogue but also draws on the curated information that was retrieved in Kialo. After all, it is a Transformer and can attend to both!\n",
